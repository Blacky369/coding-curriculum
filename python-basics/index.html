    <h1>Introduction to Python</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Get familiar with Python syntax and basic concepts.</p>

    <h2>What is Python?</h2>
    <p>Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It’s often referred to as the "English of programming languages" because of its clear syntax, making it easy for beginners to learn and understand.</p>

    <h3>Uses of Python</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Frameworks like Django and Flask help build dynamic websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Science and Analysis:</strong> Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy allow for powerful data manipulation and analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-learn are used for building machine learning models.</li>
        <li><strong>Automation and Scripting:</strong> Python is great for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Development:</strong> Libraries such as Pygame can be used to create games.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Learn Python?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Python's syntax is straightforward, making it ideal for beginners.</li>
        <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Python is used across various domains, from web development to data science.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Community:</strong> A large, supportive community means plenty of resources, tutorials, and third-party libraries.</li>
        <li><strong>Career Opportunities:</strong> Python skills are in high demand in the job market, particularly in tech, finance, and academia.</li>
        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Python is free to use and has a vast number of libraries available for various applications.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <pre>
<code>
print("Hello, world!")  # Outputs a message to the console
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers (e.g., 10).</li>
        <li><strong>Floats:</strong> Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14).</li>
        <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Text (e.g., "Hello").</li>
        <li><strong>Lists:</strong> A collection of items (e.g., <code>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</code>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here’s how you can use variables in Python:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
favorite_color = "blue"
age = 25
print("My favorite color is " + favorite_color + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Write a Python program that prints your favorite quote. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
quote = "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today."
print("My favorite quote is: " + quote)
</code>
    </pre>
