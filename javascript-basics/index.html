    <h1>JavaScript Basics</h1>

    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is like the brain of your webpage. It makes things interactive. When you click a button or fill out a form, JavaScript is often behind the scenes making it all happen!</p>

    <h2>Basic Syntax</h2>
    <pre>
<code>
let message = "Hello, world!"; // Declaring a variable
console.log(message); // Logging the message to the console
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Variables and Data Types</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Text wrapped in quotes (e.g., "Hello").</li>
        <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> Integers and floats (e.g., 5, 3.14).</li>
        <li><strong>Booleans:</strong> True or false values (e.g., true).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Here’s a simple JavaScript program that greets the user:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
let userName = "Alice"; // Change this to your name
console.log("Hello, " + userName + "! Welcome to JavaScript.");
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Create a JavaScript program that logs your name and age to the console. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
let name = "Your Name"; // Replace with your name
let age = 20; // Replace with your age
console.log("My name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Why Learning JavaScript is Valuable</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Interactivity:</strong><br>
            JavaScript allows you to add dynamic behavior to your web pages. This makes the user experience more engaging and interactive, which is crucial in today’s web environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Widespread Use:</strong><br>
            JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It’s used by developers everywhere, making it a valuable skill for job opportunities.</li>
        <li><strong>Rich Ecosystem:</strong><br>
            There are numerous libraries and frameworks built on JavaScript, like React, Angular, and Vue.js, which help streamline the development process and enhance functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Client-Side and Server-Side:</strong><br>
            JavaScript runs not only in the browser but also on the server side (using Node.js). This versatility allows developers to build full-stack applications using a single programming language.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Community Support:</strong><br>
            With a large and active community, finding resources, tutorials, and solutions to problems is easier, which is especially helpful for beginners.</li>
        <li><strong>Future-Proofing Skills:</strong><br>
            As the web continues to evolve, JavaScript remains a key technology. Understanding its principles prepares you for new frameworks and tools that are constantly being developed.</li>
    </ol>
