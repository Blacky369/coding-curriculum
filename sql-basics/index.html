    <h1>Introduction to SQL</h1>

    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>Learn the basics of SQL for querying databases.</p>

    <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
    <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language used to communicate with relational databases. Think of it as a way to ask a librarian for specific books. Instead of searching the shelves, you can use SQL to quickly find the information you need.</p>

    <h2>Uses of SQL</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> SQL is primarily used to retrieve data from databases. It allows users to filter and sort data efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> SQL can insert, update, and delete records in a database, making it essential for maintaining data integrity.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> SQL provides tools for creating and managing database structures, including tables, indexes, and views.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Analysis:</strong> Analysts use SQL to aggregate and analyze data, making it a valuable skill for data science and business intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Backend Development:</strong> Many web applications rely on SQL databases, and understanding SQL is crucial for backend developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Learn SQL?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>High Demand Skill:</strong><br>
            SQL is one of the most sought-after skills in the tech industry, with many jobs requiring proficiency in SQL.</li>
        <li><strong>Powerful Data Handling:</strong><br>
            SQL enables you to handle large volumes of data quickly and efficiently, making it easier to derive insights.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong><br>
            SQL is used across various database systems, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</li>
        <li><strong>Foundation for Data Science:</strong><br>
            Learning SQL is essential for anyone looking to work in data science or analytics, as it is commonly used to extract data from databases.</li>
        <li><strong>Streamlined Data Operations:</strong><br>
            With SQL, you can perform complex queries with ease, simplifying data manipulation and reporting tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Other Technologies:</strong><br>
            SQL often integrates with programming languages (like Python and R) and data visualization tools, making it a versatile skill.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Basic SQL Syntax</h2>
    <pre>
<code>
SELECT * FROM users;  -- Selects all columns from the users table
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>Hereâ€™s how you can query a database for all users:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
SELECT * FROM users;  -- Retrieve all user information
</code>
    </pre>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Write an SQL query to select all records from a "products" table. For example:</p>
    <pre>
<code>
SELECT * FROM products;  -- Retrieve all product information
</code>
    </pre>
