    <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>Think of HTML as the skeleton of a webpage. Just like a skeleton gives shape to your body, HTML gives structure to your web content.</p>
    <h3>Basic Structure of an HTML Document</h3>
    <pre>
    <code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
      &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Your Title Here&lt;/title&gt;
      &lt;/head&gt;
      &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Web Page&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is my first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>
  
    <h2>Key Elements of HTML</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Headings:</strong> Use <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> to define headings, with <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> being the most important.</li>
        <li><strong>Paragraphs:</strong> Use <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to define a paragraph of text.</li>
        <li><strong>Links:</strong> Use <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> to create hyperlinks to other pages or websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Images:</strong> Use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to embed images in your webpage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Understanding the Basics of HTML is Valuable</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Foundation of Web Development:</strong><br>
            HTML is the backbone of web pages. Knowing how it works helps you understand how to structure content, which is essential regardless of the tools you use.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization and Control:</strong><br>
            While platforms like WordPress and Wix simplify website creation, they also limit customization. Understanding HTML allows you to tweak your site beyond the constraints of templates and drag-and-drop interfaces.</li>
        <li><strong>Troubleshooting Skills:</strong><br>
            When something goes wrong on your website, having a grasp of HTML can help you identify issues and fix them more efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO and Accessibility:</strong><br>
            Proper HTML structure is vital for search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility. Knowing how to write semantic HTML can enhance your site's visibility on search engines and improve accessibility for users with disabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhancing Collaboration:</strong><br>
            If you work with web developers or designers, understanding HTML enables better communication. You can discuss ideas more effectively and appreciate their technical decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Future-Proofing Skills:</strong><br>
            As technology evolves, knowing HTML lays a solid foundation for learning other web technologies, such as CSS, JavaScript, and various web frameworks.</li>
    </ol>
